# MAUI AudioBookPlayer
Hello! Do you like audiobooks? I really love listening to them. I have listened to more books than I have read. :)
I created this project for personal use to experiment with the .NET <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/dotnet/maui/what-is-maui?view=net-maui-7.0">MAUI framework</a>. <br/>The project was developed using the MVVM pattern.
